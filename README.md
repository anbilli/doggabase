# Doggabase

This program is designed to process data of various dog
breeds and perform advanced searches to help the user find
the appropriate dog.

Database input is read in from a text file of entries with
the following format (commas omitted): breed, pipe-symbol "|",
hair length (s/m/l signifying short/medium/long), good guard
skills (yes/no), good with kids (yes/no), easily trained (yes/no).

Each dog entry is on a separate line. E.g. "Dingo| m no no no 33"
Executable takes the input filename as an argument.
